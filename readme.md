The current stack of Speak is what we are calling the "TTRR" stack.

- [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)

We also use RSPC to call the Typescript frontend for more of a Typesafe connection between the two.

Overall the structure of the application is simple.
