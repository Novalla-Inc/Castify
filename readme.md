The current stack of Speak is what we are calling the "TTRR" stack.

- [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)

We also use RSPC to call the Typescript frontend for more of a Typesafe connection between the two.

Overall the structure of the application is simple.

Everything relating to the `backend` can be found in `/core`

Everyhting relating to the `frontend` can be found in `/desktop`
